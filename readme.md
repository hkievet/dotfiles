# Usage of this directory

This is a list of common dotfiles that I have in my setup.  I share this directory between my home and work computer.  Run `./copy_files` to symlink the dotfiles to the `~` directory.  It will skip `*.md` files and move `init.vim` into a special directory.  The rest of this README is for my own notes of things that I learn and things I commonly forget how to do.
